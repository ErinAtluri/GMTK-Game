Definitely don’t want to be on their bad side.\n[i] Finnigan seemed to be a bit overconfident, I think remember seeing him on the news as some CEO so he definitely has a lot of money.\n[i] And Tippy, she’s very forward and flirty like she wants to get her way, but I heard another Dealer mention that she’s given bribes before. \n[i] With my skills right now, I can swap out cards from the top of the deck pretty easily while dealing, and this table should be able to quickly rotate a bit if I need to swap people’s hands.\n[i] As long as I balance out who wins, I should be able to make enough but still seem fair and make my money.
